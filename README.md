
PROJECT 2

NAME: Milton Savage

DATE OF COMPLETION: 3/24/2019

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:	TicTacToe game

OUTSIDE SOURCES / HELP: None

MESSAGE FOR TA GRADER: The board is stored as 'X', 'O', and '-' chars rather than ints, I found this made it easier to print. Starting a new game instantiates a new object.
